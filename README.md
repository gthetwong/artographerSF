ARTOGRAPHER SF

The goal of this project is to work with the google calendar API and the google maps API in order to display local artshow openings week to week. I am using data from artenthusiastSF's calendar(thank you!). By the end of this project, I would like to be able to have a list of events, a map of events, a sign in and sign out, and be able to send calendar invites or email reminders to events users sign up for.
